# Jacs Air Quality app
This is app for checking air quality in cities in Poland. Data is provided by [Główny Inspektora Ochrony Środowiska (GIOŚ)](https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/home) and fetched from their [API](https://api.gios.gov.pl/pjp-api/swagger-ui/) (Inconsistency in file naming comes from writing app in QtCreator which does not do any capitalization in filename and the coming to Clion which handles filenames as you would expect)
